📖 The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals (traditionally 25 minutes), separated by short breaks.
1 Pomodoro = 25 minutes of focused work
After 4 Pomodoros → take a long break
This method helps improve focus, reduce burnout, and increase productivity.
